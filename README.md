## Environment Variables
This project requires an `.env` file containing API keys and database credentials.

These credentials were provided to me by the company I am interning with under the guidance of Prof. Kuo Ming Chao.  
For security reasons, I cannot upload the real `.env` file to GitHub.  
Without the correct API keys and database, the system will not run.
